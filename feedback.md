## Tutor Comment
Great work! I really liked the clear and concise implementation of your code & easy to handle user-interface. I have some
suggestions for you to make your code more on the higher quality side:- 
1. It was a bit difficult for me to rotate the piece with scrolling. Could you think of any better way to achieve rotation?
2. Pieces could be placed more nicely around the board for easy access.
3. Finally I really liked clear commenting in your code, but try and avoid dead-code in your submission. (There are
no marks deduction for that but is usually not considered as a good software engineering practice). 

Overall - Awesome hard work! Keep it up team! :D
